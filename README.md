# Battle Game with Pygame

A simple turn-based battle game built using the **Pygame** library. This game features two mages (White Mage and Black Mage) engaging in a magical duel. Players can attack or heal during their turns.
This project was assisted by a wonderful tutorial series by [Coding by Russ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlolidaoiak&list=PLjcN1EyupaQnvpv61iriF8Ax9dKra-MhZ&ab_channel=CodingWithRuss). All art was drawn and owned by me.

## Features

- **Two characters**: White Mage (player controlled) and Black Mage (computer controlled).
- **Turn-based gameplay**: Player takes turns attacking or healing.
- **Dynamic animations**: Idle, attack, heal, hurt, and death animations for each character.
- **Health management**: Each mage has a health bar and limited healing abilities.
